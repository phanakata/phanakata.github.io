##### Machine learning for designing stretchable graphene kirigami
Recently, there has been great interests in using patterned cuts, often called kirigami cuts, to design stretchable materials. 
Introducing cuts allow thin materials (membranes) to extend reaching a fracture strain beyond its pristine value. 
To date, there is no a definitive theory that explains such mechanism. 
This optimization problem is highly complex and an analytical approach is only applicable for a simple case (e.g few cuts).

First part of the project is to use supervised machine learning to predict the properties of electronic kirigami membranes. 
Second part of the project is to develop reinforcement learning as well as evolutionary search algorithm to search for the optimal solutions without simulating all possible configurations.
