##### Machine learning for designing stretchable graphene kirigami
Recently, there has been great interests in using patterned cuts, often called kirigami cuts, to design stretchable materials. 
Introducing cuts allow thin materials (membranes) to extend reaching a fracture strain beyond its pristine value. Using standard computational approaches (e.g. molecular dynamics) to find a precise molecular arrangement with a specific target property is not feasible, as the number of possible ways to pattern the 2D materials grows exponentially with system size. To solve this problem, I use a machine learning (ML) approach, where data are used to provide physical insights and an effective model to describe a physical system.


To date, there is no a definitive theory that explains such mechanism. 
This optimization problem is highly complex and an analytical approach is only available for simple cases (e.g few cuts).
