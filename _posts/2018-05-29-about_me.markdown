I am a theoretical computational physicist studying fundamental properties of 2D materials and its novel applications. Based on numerical simulations, I have made effective models that are reliable, scalable, accurate, yet simple and require much less computing time. Currently, I am developing reinforcement learning and utilizing supervised machine learning methods to find the optimal design of stretchable electronic materials.

I am also passionate in writing more efficient algorithms and learning the latest technologies (such as GPU) to speed up computing time. Aside from my Ph.D. work, I am interested in developing market simulations beyond the standard Monte Carlo simulation and automated Machine Learning based trading strategies.
