I am a postdoctoral fellow in the physics department at Harvard University. I study fundamental properties of 2D materials and its novel applications using density functional theory, molecular dynamics, tight-binding, and machine learning. I currently have some fun projects in mind in the areas of thermalized membranes and deep learning for inverse design. I will be very happy to work and mentor graduate students or undergraduates in these projecs. In addition to learning physics, these projects would give you the opportunity to code, develop machine learning algorithms on TensorFlow and get you familiar with density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations. If you are interested please talk to me! 

<!--Based on numerical simulations, I have developed effective models that are scalable, accurate, yet simple and require much less computing time. In addition, I work on developing deep learning methods for inverse design in stretchable eletronic materials. Recent and past projects can be found in this webpage.-->

I am also passionate in writing more efficient algorithms and learning the latest technologies (such as GPU) to speed up computing time.
Lastly, I am trying to start posting physics problems that are, hopefully, challenging and fun for physics enthusiasts.
