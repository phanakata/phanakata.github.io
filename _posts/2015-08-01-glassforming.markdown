##### Cooperative Dynamics in Glass Forming Liquids
Ultra-thin  polymer  films  and polymer nanocomposites have  ubiquitous  technological  applications,  ranging
from electronic devices to artificial tissues.  These nanoconfined polymer materials,  typically with thickness less than 100 nm,  exhibit properties that are different from  their  bulk  counterparts. To engineer the dynamics, e.g. glass transition temperature $T_g$, remains a technological challange because lack of fundamental understanding of glass formations in polymer melts under naoconfinements.  

This research was part of my undergraduate thesis work. We studied glassy and cooperative dyanmics of glass forming liquids under nanoconfinements using molecular dynamics. 
There are three significant findings:
* We developed a unifying framework connecting string-like cooperative motions and relaxation time. 
* We established a direct relation between dynamical interfacial scales and the strings (and so the relaxation time).
* We developed a theory connecting the long relaxation time and the Debye-Waller factor which characterizes the dyanmics at a short time scale.
